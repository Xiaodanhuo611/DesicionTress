# 2. Build 2 models: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree (shallow). Compare the test results using classification_report and confusion_matrix. Which algorithm is superior? First split them into a training dataset and test set
# 2. Repeat 1. but let the Decision Tree be much deeper to allow over-fitting. Compare the two models' test results again, and explain why it's superior
